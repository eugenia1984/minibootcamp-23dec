# minibootcamp-23dec
Hi everyone, today I had the second class of the  miniBootcamp with Alejandro Zapata. We saw the basic structure of an HTML file, with the tags inside the HEAD and BODY. We practise a bit with the h1 tag, paragrapg tag, some ordered and unorderer list, and end up with the image tag.
