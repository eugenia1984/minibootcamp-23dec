# miniBootcamp 23dec with José Alejandro Zapata
## What I did 🚀
_Hi everyone, today I had the second class of the  miniBootcamp with Alejandro Zapata. <br/>
We saw the basic structure of an HTML file, with the tags inside the HEAD and BODY. <br/>
We practise a bit with the h1 tag, paragrapg tag, some ordered and unorderer list, and end up with the image tag. <br/>
Now I will start to code the challenge of the day, so….wait to see it_
